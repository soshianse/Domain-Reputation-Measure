Domain Reputation Measure
=========================

**Domain Reputation Measure** is a multi-phase project aimed at delivering a robust system for assessing the trustworthiness of internet domains. By analyzing various layers of domain infrastructure, including DNS, IP, and ASN data, this system produces actionable domain reputation scores that can aid in cybersecurity, risk analysis, and brand protection.

The **Domain ASN Mapper**, developed in **Phase 1**, is the foundational tool that enables this analysis by mapping domains to their underlying network infrastructure.

Project Overview
----------------

The **Domain Reputation Measure** project evaluates domain infrastructure from multiple angles---DNS records, WHOIS details, BGP announcements, and IP registration history. The system will ultimately produce real-time, reputation-based scoring that reflects a domain's risk profile, helping organizations mitigate threats before they escalate.

* * * * *

Strategic Importance
--------------------

As cyber threats become increasingly complex, reliable domain reputation assessment is critical. Whether for blacklisting suspicious domains or evaluating infrastructure trustworthiness, organizations require tools that analyze both the behavior and architecture of domains. This project addresses that need with a layered, scalable, and modular system.

Phase 1: Domain ASN Mapper
--------------------------

Phase 1 delivers a powerful utility that maps domains to Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), revealing the network footprint and infrastructure relationships of domain names. This mapping is foundational to future phases of reputation scoring.

### Architecture

The Domain ASN Mapper is built with a modular design that enables both automation and ease of use. Its core components include:

-   **DNS Processor**: Resolves A, AAAA, NS, and MX records for domains

-   **ASN Processor**: Maps IP addresses to ASNs using MRT data files

-   **Output Formatter**: Supports JSON, CSV, and text output formats

-   **Web Interface**: User-friendly front end for uploading files and visualizing results

### Features

-   üì° Full DNS Resolution: A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), NS, MX records

-   üåê ASN Mapping: Accurate IP-to-ASN correlation using MRT datasets

-   ‚öôÔ∏è IP Version Control: Filter by IPv4 or IPv6

-   üõ†Ô∏è Dual Interfaces: Command-line and browser-based UI

-   üìÅ Multiple Formats: JSON, CSV, and text outputs

-   üöÄ Scalable & Resilient: Designed to handle large input sets with robust error handling

Usage
-----

### Web Interface

Start the local server:

bash

```bash

`python main.py --web`
```
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`:

1.  Upload a file with domain names (one per line)

2.  Upload the MRT file containing ASN data

3.  Select output format and IP version filters

4.  Click "Process Files" to begin mapping

### Command Line

bash

```bash

`python main.py -d domains.txt -m mrt_file.mrt -o results.json -f json`
```
#### Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-d, --domains` | Path to domains file |
| `-m, --mrt-file` | MRT file path |
| `-o, --output` | Output file path |
| `-f, --format` | Output format: `json`, `csv`, `text` |
| `--ipv4-only` / `--ipv6-only` | Filter by IP version |
| `--web` | Launch the web interface |

Phase 2 & Beyond
----------------

The groundwork laid in Phase 1 enables the next stages of the Domain Reputation Measure project:

### üîê Phase 2: Reputation Scoring Engine (Planned)

-   Integrate domain-ASN mapping with:

    -   Tranco list rank history

    -   BGP activity analysis

    -   Domain registration metadata

-   Develop a weighted scoring algorithm

-   Build an API for real-time domain reputation queries

### üìä Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Dashboard (Planned)

-   Anomaly detection & ML-based reputation prediction

-   Visualization dashboard for reputation trends

-   Batch and API integrations for security platforms

Input & Output Formats
----------------------

### Input

A plain text file of domains:

CopyEdit

`example.com
github.com
